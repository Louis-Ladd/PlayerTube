                <h2 id="1">Creating a Custom Theme</h2>
                <p>
                    Custom themes in PlayerTube are made up of a number of options available in
                    PlayerTube's settings. You can share, edit, or make your own theme to however
                    you like. The custom theme options are basically like lines of CSS code, being
                    able to change their values but with a bit more hand-holding. In this guide,
                    we will be using the <kbd>Custom Theme Settings</kbd> section of PlayerTube's
                    settings to start our creation of a custom theme.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's start with the basics!
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 id="11">Enabling Custom Themes</h3>
                <p>
                    To enable custom themes, head over to the PlayerTube extension icon at the top
                    of your browser. A popup should appear with the PlayerTube settings. We'll be
                    using this a lot throughout the guide, so remember how to access it!
                    <br>
                    Inside of the PlayerTube configuration popup, scroll down to
                    <kbd>Custom Theme Settings</kbd> and click on <kbd>Toggle Custom Theme</kbd>.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/docs/custom-theme-option.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;">
                <p>
                    Once the toggle option is set to on (aka is green), relaunch the PlayerTube
                    settings, scroll down to the <kbd>Custom Theme Settings</kbd> again, and you
                    should notice many more options for customization!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that some options in the custom theme selection might not need any
                    changing, so make sure to read the option's title <b>and description</b> before
                    changing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can find out what each type of option does by looking at the
                    <a class="page-selection" href="#2">Custom Theme Options</a> part of this guide,
                    but most are easy to understand and we won't go over each one in this section.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 id="12">Creating a Custom Scrubber</h3>
                <p>
                    When it comes to setting a custom scrubber, it'll need some patience and hope
                    to get perfect, but it'll be worth our pain & suffering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this, we'll be using this
                    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hJbFUyj.gif" target="_blank">GIF of Luigi walkin' with a hammer</a>.
                    You may use the same image for practicing reasons.
                </p>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hJbFUyj.gif" style="display: block;width: 6rem;margin: auto;">
                <p>
                    If you're using your own image, make sure your image is uploaded to a website
                    with <kbd>https://</kbd>, like <a href="https://imgur.com/">Imgur</a> or any
                    other image hosting website that is free to access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, we'll apply the GIF to the <a class="page-selection" href="#22">link option</a>
                    on <kbd>Change the image of the Scrubber</kbd> under
                    <kbd>Scrubber Base Settings</kbd>.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/docs/scrubber-link-input.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;">
                <p>
                    If you'll be using a different image when hovering over the scrubber, you may
                    set that under the
                    <kbd>Change the image of the Scrubber <b>when hovering</b></kbd> link option
                    <br>
                    Make sure that both the static and hover images you'll be using are the same
                    size dimension-wise.
                    <br>
                    No need to change this option if you'll be using the same image for each
                    condition.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/docs/scrubber-link-hover-input.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;">
                <p>
                    Next, let's temporarily set the scrubber size to <kbd>12</kbd> by using the
                    <kbd>Change the image size of the Scrubber</kbd>
                    <a class="page-selection" href="#23">number option</a> under
                    <kbd>Scrubber Size</kbd> and load into a YouTube video to test out.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/docs/scrubber-first.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;">
                <p>
                    If you're able to tell that your image is there, or if it even changed to
                    what the scrubber was before, you're getting there!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your scrubber image is too small, like shown in the screenshot above,
                    I recommend multiplying or adding to it's current value by two. You can do
                    the opposite if the image is bigger (obviously).
                    <br>
                    Make sure to reload the YouTube page everytime you update PlayerTube's
                    configuration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When changing the image size, don't worry if the image seems to be cut off.
                    You can use the <kbd>Change the height of the Scrubber</kbd> and
                    <kbd>Change the width of the Scrubber</kbd> number options that is below the
                    <kbd>Change the image size of the Scrubber</kbd> number option to make the
                    scrubber image appear and make it's actual size bigger.
                    <br>
                    Use the default size mentioned in the options' description for the height
                    and width, which should be <kbd></kbd>, and change it so that it's perfect
                    with the scrubber image you set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you'd like to move the scrubber itself, you can find all the position
                    settings under <kbd>Scrubber Position</kbd>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this, you should have a complete custom scrubber! Hope this helps with
                    your custom theme journey.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 id="13">Copying & Sharing your Custom Theme</h3>
                <p>
                    To get a shareable version of your custom theme, use the
                    <kbd>Copy Custom Theme Settings to Clipboard</kbd> button at the top of the
                    <kbd>Custom Theme Settings</kbd> section of PlayerTube's configuration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The users that want to use your custom theme will have to follow the steps on
                    <a class="page-selection" href="#3">Adding a Custom Theme</a> on this page to
                    apply it using the settings you get from the
                    <kbd>Copy Custom Theme Settings to Clipboard</kbd> button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One other thing that should be obvious is that the custom theme can be changed
                    by the users, meaning you should have a open-mind when others change it.
                    Sharing your theme doesn't lock it so only you can edit it, as anyone else
                    could do the same with or without a lock (if there was any but there ain't!!!).
                </p>


                <br>
                <br>
                <br>


                <h2 id="2">Custom Theme Options</h2>
                <p>
                    Basic documentation about each option found in the custom theme selection.
                    This also should be obvious, but the turning icon button resets the option next
                    to it.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 id="21">Color Option</h3>
                <p>
                    A color option is used to set a custom color for the option it's linked to.
                    Powered by <a href="https://coloris.js.org/" target="_blank">Coloris</a>.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/docs/color-selector-option.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;">
                <p>
                    Sometimes the box may appear as a HEX value and may not be usuable. If this
                    happens, reopen PlayerTube's settings popup, as this is an issue with Coloris
                    and the settings popup script which I'm too lazy to fix.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may click on the box next to the option on the right, and a color menu
                    popup should show.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/docs/color-selector-menu.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;">
                <p>
                    You can either:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Use the many different sliders in the menu to change the color's hue,
                            brightness, saturation, and transparency.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    or
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Use the HEX value at the bottom of the color menu popup. (Which should be
                            of use if you're using the same color for multiple settings in your theme)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 id="22">Link Option</h3>
                <p>
                    Links are mainly used for a custom scrubber in your theme. 
                    <br>
                    All link options should be start with <kbd>https://</kbd> and <b>not
                    <kbd>http://</kbd></b>, as YouTube uses <kbd>https://</kbd>.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/docs/link-option.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;">
                <p>
                    Pretty straight forward -- paste a link to a image into the box next to the option
                    and that should do the trick.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 id="23">Number Option</h3>
                <p>
                    Number options hold a number or value, mainly used for changing the size or
                    position of something by pixels (aka <kbd>pxs</kbd>)
                </p>
                <img src="../img/docs/number-option.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;">
                <p>
                    Simply input a number into the box next to the option's title to set it's value.
                </p>


                <br>
                <br>
                <br>


                <h2 id="3">Adding a Custom Theme</h2>
                <b>If you're coming from the last parts of this guide, this part is not needed.</b>
                <p>
                    Adding a custom theme is very simple in PlayerTube. All you have to do is get the
                    code that the custom theme's author has given, and paste it into the
                    <kbd>Import, Copy, or Reset Settings</kbd> text box on PlayerTube's configuration
                    popup, then click the <kbd>Apply Settings</kbd>.
                    <br>
                    After that, reload your YouTube page, and your custom theme should work without a
                    issue!
                </p>
