                    Some YouTube extensions may mess with PlayerTube, and many more might
                    if not reported on. If you'd like to help with finding & getting many
                    more extensions fixed, <a href='https://github.com/ktg5/PlayerTube/issues'>
                    feel free to report them on the GitHub page</a>.
                    <br>
                    Here's the current list of extensions that currently work either with
                    or without manual configuration.
                </p>
                <h3>CustomTube</h3>
                <p>
                    CustomTube has been one of the first extensions to need manual
                    configuration. Below is a screenshot of what settings the user should
                    set.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/customtube-settings.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;">
                <p>
                    Go to the "Watch Page" tab in CustomTube's settings, scroll down to
                    "Video Player Size" and disable "Use Custom Player Size".
                    Also set "Video Player Style" to "Use current player" to be safe.
                    <br>
                    CustomTube also needed many CSS patches too (which does not need to
                    be done by the user).
                </p>
                <h3>YouTube Redux</h3>
                <p>
                    Like CustomTube, YouTube Redux has similar settings that mess with
                    the player's size.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/youtube-redux-settings.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;">
                <p>
                    Open up YouTube Redux's settings and uncheck the "Use small video
                    player" opinion.
                    <br>
                    And for some reason, YouTube Redux messes with the volume panel,
                    which is easily fixed with some CSS (which does not need to be
                    done by the user).
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Other extensions that have been patched</h3>

                <li>SponsorBlock - CSS patches mainly adjusting the little things that appear on top of the progress bar</li>
                <li>Truffle - Mainly stuff when viewing a live stream</li>
