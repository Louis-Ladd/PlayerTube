                <h2>Yo! What's good!</h2>
                Thanks for installing PlayerTube! One of my first browser extensions &
                one of the best additions to the look & feel of YouTube! (In my best
                and 100% accurate opinion)
                <br>
                <br>
                This extension is basically the continuation of my userscript,
                <a href="https://github.com/ktg5/YT-HTML5-Player/">YT-HTML5-Player</a>.
                <br>
                The reason I made the script into a extension is because it's easier to
                install & manage, more people could find the script, no need for
                userscript extensions like Tampermonkey, plus synced settings across
                devices connected to the same account on your browser.
                <br>
                <h3>YouTube Extension Compatibility</h3>
                <p>
                    If you use any extra extensions for YouTube,
                    <a href="extensions.html">please check the Extension Support page</a>
                    as some extensions may need manual configuration.
                </p>
                <br>
                If you possibly step upon an issue such as something with the styling,
                slower performance, something conflicting with another YouTube extension,
                or whatever you think seems off,
                <a href='https://github.com/ktg5/PlayerTube/issues'>
                feel free to report them on the GitHub page!</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Thanks and have the most awesome of awesome days!
