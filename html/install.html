                Thanks for installing PlayerTube!
                <br>
                <br>
                This extension is basically the continuation of my userscript,
                <a href="https://github.com/ktg5/YT-HTML5-Player/">YT-HTML5-Player</a>.
                <br>
                The reason I made the script into a extension is because it's easier to
                install & manage, more people could find the script, no need for
                userscript extension like Tampermonkey, plus synced settings across
                devices connected to the same account on your browser.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you possibly step upon an issue, such as an issue with the styling,
                another YouTube extension, or whatever that comes to this extension,
                <a href='https://github.com/ktg5/PlayerTube/issues'>feel free to report them on the GitHub page!</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Thanks and have the most awesome of awesome days!
