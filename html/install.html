                <h2>Yo! What's good!</h2>
                Thanks for installing PlayerTube! One of my first browser extensions &
                one of the best additions to the look & feel of YouTube! (In my best
                and 100% accurate opinion)
                <br>
                <br>
                This extension is basically the continuation of my userscript,
                <a href="https://github.com/ktg5/YT-HTML5-Player/">YT-HTML5-Player</a>.
                <br>
                The reason I made the script into a extension is because it's easier to
                install & manage, more people could find the script, no need for
                userscript extensions like Tampermonkey, plus synced settings across
                devices connected to the same account on your browser.
                <br>
                <h3>For those running CustomTube:</h3>
                <p>
                    If by any chance you encounter issues when it comes to the look and
                    feel of the YouTube player with PlayerTube & CustomTube enabled,
                    please make sure to set "Use current player" in the "Watch Page"
                    tab in the CustomTube settings.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/customtube-settings.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;" alt="Go to the 'Watch Page' tab in CustomTube's settings, scroll down to 'Video Player Style' and set it to 'Use current player'.">
                <br>
                <br>
                If you possibly step upon an issue such as something with the styling,
                slower performance, something conflicting with another YouTube extension,
                or whatever you think seems off,

                <br>
                <br>
                Thanks and have the most awesome of awesome days!
